<!-- This file can be run from either EvacVisual or ExperimentSequence -->

<!-- This file is INTENDED for visualisation, as it does not have repeats or independent variables-->

<!-- No bells and whistles, this simulation is a base case on a 6*6 grid -->
<!-- Agents find the shortest path and stick to it nomatter what -->

<!-- This simulation is great to watch vehicle and traffic behaviour in action -->
