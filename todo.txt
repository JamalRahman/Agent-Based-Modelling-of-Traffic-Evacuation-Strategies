Allow parameters to be tweaked in MASON panel

Allow 1-click choice of preset scenarios

Batch simulation
Data collection / analysis tools

Parmeterize all speeds/accelerations by a time factor (seconds)
    The same time factor is an input into the scheduleRepeating so we can step over other time intervals
    not just per second

Implement Greediness

Implement batch simulation

Tidy code

Implement throttling & Contraflow

Implement method of reading network topology from file

Implement scheduling & routing





Make for nicer & easier setup
    Methodize setup.
        Move some setup into Car.init() ???
    Allow for parameterized map setup with a single method call
        Fields set up programattically

Easy experiment setup
 - Simple parameter change
 - Simple map style change

Customisable options in Mason window
    Population size
    car properties
    map type
    etcgit s

Tidy Car.java

Implement greediness

Implement throttling & Contraflow

Implement scheduling & routing

Implement user friendly features. Easier simulation setup.

Attempt to use GeoMason to read GIS data
    Handwrite a class which can convert GeoMason networks into plain MASON networks of junctions/roads
run some experimizzles

Comment everything you dummy
