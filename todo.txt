Fix driving algorithm
If the car calculates movement and traverses across to a new edge, if there is a car immediately on the new edge which
is only a couple of meters away the agent should leave a buffer between itself and its neighbour.
In this scenario that buffer would imply the car ACTUALLY DOESNT traverse across to the new edge, as the buffer would
backspill the agent back to it's current edge.
Need to implement a look-forward clause in calculateMovement which accounts for this

Implement Test Network

Implement greediness

Implement throttling & Contraflow
