Constrain physical movement to network locations
    Get real-world coordinate for a given index along a given road
    Car's track their edges and roads properly
    Handle residual movement
        Also calculating progress dependent on environment status

REFACTOR HACKY CODE:
    Beautify movement methods, methodise code.

Refactor agent setup from EvacSim to Car
    Goal assignment(?)
    A* Search

Refactor A* to return list of edges rather than nodes/junctions?

Implement driving algorithm

Implement throttling

Implement greediness

Implement scheduling & routing

Attempt to use GeoMason to read GIS data
    Handwrite a class which can convert GeoMason networks into plain MASON networks of junctions/roads
run some experimizzles

Comment everything you dummy
