Read network from file
Other fields set up their sizes according to the network size

Make Experiment object set up CoreSimulation according to properties file



Option to spawn agents on node or spawn agents on edge somewhere

Car is messy and gross again
    See if we can't make that nicer
    Less void methods that work with fields more methods which take arguments and return them
        So we can CHOOSE when fields are updated versus when we use the methods just for their functionality

Batch simulation
Data collection / analysis tools

Implement user friendly parameter-input

Comment

Implement scheduling & routing





Make for nicer & easier setup
    Methodize setup.
        Move some setup into Car.init() ???
    Allow for parameterized map setup with a single method call
        Fields set up programattically

Easy experiment setup
 - Simple parameter change
 - Simple map style change

Customisable options in Mason window
    Population size
    car properties
    map type
    etcgit s

Tidy Car.java

Implement greediness

Implement throttling & Contraflow

Implement scheduling & routing

Implement user friendly features. Easier simulation setup.

Attempt to use GeoMason to read GIS data
    Handwrite a class which can convert GeoMason networks into plain MASON networks of junctions/roads
run some experimizzles
