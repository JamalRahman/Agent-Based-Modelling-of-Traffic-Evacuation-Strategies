Constrain physical movement to network locations
    Research how GeoMason handles such constraints

Implement driving algorithm

Implement throttling

Implement greediness

Implement scheduling & routing

Attempt to use GeoMason to read GIS data
    Handwrite a class which can convert GeoMason networks into plain MASON networks of junctions/roads
run some experimizzles
